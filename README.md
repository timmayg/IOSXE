IOS XE Templates

This repo will contain several templates for IOS XE. 
These templates will follow all the best practices that I am aware of. 

These templates will be numbered and when building a new IOS XE device I apply them in that order. For templates where there could be different options they will be numbered with a letter (1a, 1b, 1c). In these instances please choose one template.
